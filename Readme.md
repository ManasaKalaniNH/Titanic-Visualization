Summary
The Royal Mail Steamer Titanic tragedy is one of the most infamous maritime distaster in history. The ship sank on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
Titanic was ranked among the most sophisticated and luxurious of it's time and the disaster created worldwide shock regarding the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it.
The data for analysis contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. The data was already cleaned and summarised as a part of the project Investigate a Dataset
Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women when compared to men, and the upper-class.

Design
Version1
I chose bar plot since it shows the relationship between categorical variable. The plot shows the percentage of Male/Female survived in each class.
The percentage was calculated by number of Female/Male survived by Total number of Female/Male were actually there in the respective class.
I preferred pastel colors for legends as it will not give more emphasis on the color than the findings. 
This is my initial version of my project and  will go through changes after the feedback.

Version2
After the feedback session I realised there was less of interaction in the visualisation an additional chart was included which will show the count of people who survived.
Two buttons were added which will display the percentage and count respectively.

Version3
A bar plot of just the count of who survived will not give a clear understanding as the number of people in each class varied.
So a stacked bar was used to display the count bar plot which stacked the count of people who survived and who died. 
As the visualization was kind of completed from my point of view. I shared this with my feedback questions to three people.

Version4 --Final Version
From all the feedback it was clear that the buttons didnot look like buttons. So I customised the buttons to get more of a button look.
The female-male (order of bars ) where made the same order of the legend as per the feedback.
The feedbacks also suggested to have different color for each passenger class. This was not done as it is better to compare the bars in each 
categorical variable when they have same shade.


Feedback
a) Version1
No Interaction

b) Version2
Bar plot with count is not giving the clear communication 

c) Version 3
The questions asked for final feedback are:
1.What do you notice in the visualization?
2.What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
3.Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
4.Any suggestions to improve the visualization?

Feedback from person1
1.What do you notice in the visualization?
Ans: The visualization shows the survival rates for different classes of passengers and gender.
The visualization shows the number of people survived and perished for different classes of passengers and gender
2.What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Ans: The visualization shows the survival rates for different classes of passengers and gender.
3.Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
Ans: The count/percentage does not look like buttons.
The visualization in the graph is female-male (order of bars) whereas in the label its male-female and is a bit confusing.
4.Any suggestions to improve the visualization?
Ans: The classes can be different colour and the male-female can be differentiated with a shading


Feedback from person2
1.What do you notice in the visualization?
Ans: Stark difference in the male to female ratio in survival rate
2.What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Ans: 1)First class passengers who have survived (both male and females) greater than the other classes.(class 2 and 3)
2)Least difference in male female survival rate in class 3
3.Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
Ans: The buttons look like labels more than buttons
4.Any suggestions to improve the visualization?
Ans: nil

Feedback from person2
1.What do you notice in the visualization?
Ans: Difference in survival rate in each passenger class and the gender
2.What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Ans: The richer you are the longer you live.
3.Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
Nil
4.Any suggestions to improve the visualization?
Ans: Add color to buttons to get a clickable feel.
