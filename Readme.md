Summary
The Royal Mail Steamer Titanic tragedy is one of the most infamous maritime distaster in history. The ship sank on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Titanic was ranked among the most sophisticated and luxurious of it's time and the disaster created worldwide shock regarding the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it.
The data for analysis contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. The data was already cleaned and summarised as a part of the project Investigate a Dataset
Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women when compared to men, and the upper-class.

Design
Version1
I chose bar plot since it shows the relationship for categorical variable. The plot shows the percentage of Male/Female survived in each class. The percentage was calculated by number of Female/Male survived by Total number of Female/Male were actually there in the respective class. I preferred pastel colors for legends as it will not give more emphasis on the color than the findings. This is my initial version of my project and  will go through changes after the feedback.

Version2
As there was less of interaction in the visualisation an additional chart was included which will show the count of people who survived. Two buttons were added which will display the percentage and count respectively.

Version3
A bar plot of just the count of who survived will not give a clear understanding as the number of people in each class varied. So a stacked bar was used to display the count bar plot which stacked the count of people who survived and who died.

Feedback
Version1
No Interaction

Version2
Bar plot with count is not giving the clear communication
